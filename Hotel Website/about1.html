                <p>We had a great time! The Hatch was comfortably furnished and had everything that you need (AC, fully equipped kitchen). It was also very quiet, so that we could truly enjoy our stay and relax the whole day.
                    The cleaning service was great and we were provided with fresh towels about every 3 days, which is uncommon for most accommodations.</p>
